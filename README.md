1.) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

    Reading over the user stories can give you a better understanding of the user's wants and needs and some of them even offer ideas on how they may want it implemented.

2.) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
    There are multiple ways to approach program development. Throughout this course I learned of the waterfall methodology as well as the agile methodology.
    Both of these methods offer their own pros and cons and they are both used in companies today although agile has grown to become more popular than waterfall.
    I hope to incorporate agile in my future development work because I have learned how to use it throughout the course. We didn't really learn how to use the waterfall
    we just skimmed over the general method.
    
3.) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
    Being a good team member is someone that respects their team and stays within the team's standards. Being a good team member is important, especially in software
    development. If the entire team is full of good team members there is almost nothing that can hold that team back.
